This code finds the transmission (KT) and reflection coefficients (KR) for different wave energy converter archetypes. The folder titled "coeff" finds KT and KR from the body's hydrodynamic and hydrostatic coefficients, radiation potential of the wave field, and exciting force on the body. The folder titled "hydro" finds KT and KR based on wave height ratios and the disturbance coefficient.
