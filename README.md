To use this repository, it is recommended to create an environment using the "requirements.txt" file provided. If not, you will need to install Capytaine (https://capytaine.github.io/stable/) and potentially other python packages. 

This code finds the transmission (Kt) and reflection coefficients (Kr) for different wave energy converter archetypes based on fluid structure interactions. The devices modeled in this code are:

1. Heaving Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter
2. Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter
3. Attenuator Wave Energy Converter
4. Floating Breakwater

The transmission and reflection coefficients are calculated in the "hydro" folder using the "run_coeffs.py" script or "generate_data.py". More details are found in the folder README.md file.
